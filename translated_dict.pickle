Until the junior high school era, it has absolutely no hobbies, bad social connection, we are not good at reading the air and bad luck. For that reason, I have a past that has been isolated and stupid (I call it Ryuuji "my friend who made it for the first time"). Talkative tone is always polite language regardless of the opponent.\n\xc2\xa0I am not good at domestic affairs because of bad guidance.\n\xc2\xa0In spite of his hard work he fell to the first high school he wants to enroll in, and entered a private high school that is not slipping. However, we contracted the share house \xc2\xb7 Kayaso as a boarding house where mistakenly encouraged members live, and it will be confused, but will continue to move in after twists and turns.\n\xc2\xa0I was forced to find a talent for Shogi by Taikin, and until then I did not even know the rules but I will become a professional shogi player.\n\xc2\xa0It is said to be one point breakthrough thinking ability (tunnelminder), and because of the way to think all possible hands, it is possible to think of the final stage warfare and closing, in the tsume - shogi without mistaking thought to the end, but in the midstight there are too many possibilities I am not interested in hesitating what to do.\n\xc2\xa0However, each time considering countermeasures by setting a small goal, countermeasures were taken by narrowing the hand of the early stage only to the tactics of the Yakura enclosure, and then overcoming with special training of about two months afterwards.\n\xc2\xa0It is a reckless behavior that aims to become professional from high school students, and Taikin gave a task "I\'m going to be the number one in Tokyo first" and I was aiming for winning in the high school club activities tournament.\n\xc2\xa0In the group battle of the city competition that participated with the dragon grub, it was originally confirmed by two people in a team of three people ref group Note nameex is not allowed in actual rules. For ref, he will serve as a general, and will fight against captains of the highest rank such as Shingo Cape Shin and Sengoku Motoharu.\n\xc2\xa0In the subsequent encouragement test, Okamori barely broke through the discretion of Omori who felt something in faith, although he struggled with losing to Mokuro Shiro in the first place.

Although it enters the encouragement meeting from early, it enters the three - tier league, but there is near the age when it can not go up to four tiers for ten years there and becomes a withdrawal due to age restriction.\n\xc2\xa0I believe that I believe that I will be rewarded someday when I go to the genius and continue to work hard, encouraging the beliefs I was worrying about whatever I did, no result.\n\xc2\xa0Although he was a talented enough to be called a genius of a rare genius, he became strong without a belief in shogi, so he fears to kick other people by winning.\n\xc2\xa0As a result, I can not always win the top prize and the top two standing in the 3 rd league which is promoted to professional in the 3 rd ranks Refnestgroup Note In the actual system, taking the third place twice can be transferred to the free class It is possible to become a professional players.\nref nameexcite weburlhttp wwwshogiorjpmatchshoreikaiprovisionhtmltitle Encouragement provision | encouragement | Japanese shogi federation accessdateref.\n\xc2\xa0Thai Kim, who was forced to go through the league and became a neurosis, felt it was troublesome even by the sound of a piece, requested that the next resident should not be an encouraging member, and it was a belief that came there.\n\xc2\xa0Two years later, it is 6 steps, ranking B is becoming a title challenger ref group Note nameex impossible in actual system. refref nameexcite weburlhttpwwwshogiorjpmatchjunniruleshtmltitle About ranking | Master war | chess game | Japan Shogi Federation accessdateref.\n\xc2\xa0Prefecture Ginaya (Aagata ginga)\n\xc2\xa0An old man.

One day, classmate Hideno Tonano knows her secret, but while she pulls down the story she will cooperate with her dream of "making friends." Meanwhile, Iya High School is one of the prefecture\'s most advanced schools, but it is a school where only students with strong academics gather, and Konomi and Tono-kun are going to have tough days in order to achieve their goals.\n\n\xc2\xa0Character \n\xc2\xa0main character \n\xc2\xa0Kotomi Glass (Komi Shouko)\n\xc2\xa0Komi is a community disease.\n\xc2\xa0The main character of this work. I am a regular associate at Iya High School. A glittery black hair of straight long and a very well-appointed appearance, owner of a slender body. Though its appearance is regarded as being Madonna because of its appearance, herself is not very good at socializing, and it is a level of "communicable disease" at a level where everyday conversation does not persist. However, I have a dream of overcoming it and building relationships and "I want to make friends", and from my point of view I made friends with cooperation of Mr. Todano who realized that she is "community disease" It will start.\n\xc2\xa0I can hardly talk with other people, and if I try to speak it forcibly, I trembly shake like the vibrating function of the mobile phone. However, there are many cases where the surroundings often assume those who are better, and as a result they are treated as "gods" in the class. Writing is possible through a blackboard or a notebook, and I always carry notes and writing instruments, but sometimes I forget and solidify.\n\xc2\xa0Although it is a beautiful woman as much as mentioned above, her face often becomes a gag touch when he is hardened or when he is dazzling. If you motivate it, cat ears grow, and your nose may be rough. I also like cats.\n\xc2\xa0Family living together are parents and younger brother.\n\xc2\xa0It is my first time friend and gradually becomes conscious of heterosexuality, Tadano who is a good understanding person who always care about myself. The first thing registered in the phone book of the mobile phone (Garakey) bought after entering high school is Tano \'s telephone number. Dresses for summer clothes were selected in the play by Tanoo.\n\n\xc2\xa0Hitoshi Nodano (just a person)\nVoice Ichigaya Haruichi (Year of Month CM)\n\xc2\xa0Mr. Tonodano is just a person.\n\xc2\xa0Yearly classroom chairperson. From my experiences of failing to make individuality in my junior high school days, I think that at high school I would like to live like a wave without making it not noticeable. Appearance, academic achievement, height, weight, etc. are not conspicuous especially normal or average. Skating can also slide normally. Even if you dress up in shemale, it suits yourself well, well received by men in class and Kotomi. From the beginning I noticed that Mr. Komi is a "community disease", and after that I will cooperate in making her friends.\n\xc2\xa0I say that my special skill is "to read the air", but there are clauses that are not so apparent from many other classmates. Also, it is easy for others to work on various jobs and roles, and that is why I became a school committee chairperson. However, it is very long to tell the feelings of those who have difficulty in communication skill including Mr. Komi and it is also often that you can put Tsukkomi in the breasts of other people\'s breasts as well (from familiarity It is described as "ability to read mind"). However, it is said that the difference between men and women \'s subtleties is unclear, and from familiar it is said, "It is hard to guess, it is bad, because it is stupid", From Mine peak, "The difference between good and bad places is great".\n\xc2\xa0For Mr. Komi, he was in love like a love at first sight when he first met, but at first it was like a longing as opponent who has no relationship with him. After that, as she struggled as a good understanding person, she began to consciously become a heterosexual person, and although we do not have consciousness, we are mutually love relationship.\n\xc2\xa0Long-name familiar (Osana familiar)\n\xc2\xa0The long-known familiarity is familiar.\n\xc2\xa0Yearly classroom vice chairperson. The owner of a phenomenal communication ability to get close to everyone in a matter of distance and become close to each other, from Tadano is said to be "the right to communicate". However, there was a lie in hypothesis and the behavior did not agree with each other, and gender was unknown, while in junior high school he was dressed as a boy\'s pupil, but in high school she looked like a girls student (blouses and skirts are the same as other female students , Wearing a tie for a male instead of a ribbon), and many other mysteries. Because I am transferring repeatedly, I am a childhood friend with all the students of the school including Kotomi and Tono, and I also know the black history of Tono.\n\xc2\xa0I met him for the first time when I was in elementary school grade but it was trauma as the only person I could not make friends for the first time, and initially I had no intention to communicate without having to go through Mr. Odo. However, by understanding Mr. Komi\'s real image, it gradually comes into contact with us.\n\n\xc2\xa0Private Isami High School\n\n\xc2\xa0Year group\n\n\xc2\xa0Girls\n\xc2\xa0Uesugi Emiko (Ashige Himiko)\n\xc2\xa0Mr. Kamiji is an ascetic disease.\n\xc2\xa0Eyeglass character elegant daughter who will serve as a book committee member of the year. It is weak against the pressure from others due to social phobia, I can not be confident in myself. I am secretly beloved Ms. Tomomi and I tried to refuse to suggest that she would be friends from Todano, but I finally agree to the form of "Kotomi\'s dog" in the end. On the other hand, it is a considerable diet, and in the topic about foods such as ramen, it shows a tasteful and bullish part that has changed from usual. It is considerable big tits, according to familiar data, it is a pattern of B \xc2\xb7 W \xc2\xb7 H.\n\xc2\xa0Yamai Koi (Yamairi Len)\n\xc2\xa0Mr. Yamai is Yande.\n\xc2\xa0It is a leader in the group of women of the year group, and there are also a lot of entourage. Mr. Kotomi is called "Kotomi sama" secretly worshiped, and his favor is too strong mindfully becomes a condition of Yandere sickness, but he himself refers to "ordinary high school student" himself . Though it sometimes exposed attackability against those who are trying to approach Mr. Komi, especially Mr. Tonokuno who often acts with her, she becomes a friend through twists and turns. In work, it is the valuable (?) Person who turned out earnestly Mr. Komi being real seriously, once refused a friend relationship.\n\xc2\xa0Masayuki Yadano (Mare \'s Melting)\n\xc2\xa0Mr. Yadano is disgusted with it.\n\xc2\xa0A girl holding a rivalry heart to Mr. Komi. I\'m struggling without pretending to win against her, but like every time I have a crushing defeat. In comparison with the position of "Kami" of Kotomi, I call the position in my own class "commoner", but in fact it seems to be popular to the extent that fan clubs can be formed. Special skill is facial tricks.\n\xc2\xa0Middle-aged Spring (pretty good as well)\n\xc2\xa0Midway-san is Nakaji disease.\n\xc2\xa0Chubu sick character who speaks a dubious word and calls "Marsort \xc2\xb7 Less \xc2\xb7 Primavera" is a genuine name. I hide the left eye with an eye patch and a bandage on the left hand. Although I was lonely without disappointment in the temperament, I became friends with Mr. Komi with setting "The power of contraindication inside the body (Dragon Force) reacted." It has won a place with overwhelming difference in the men\'s delusional episode ranking of volumes.\n\xc2\xa0Inukani Noko (here in Inanaka)\n\xc2\xa0Mr. Inuka is a redneck.\n\xc2\xa0I am making it complex from the countryside, I secretly admire Komi as an Onna in the city secretly. Actually, my hometown is with my grandmother. In Commu, in the New Year we will have to make a shrine maiden \'s bite with Komi - san. Being a redneck from inside the class is ballet. There are so-called duty times more than once, there is also involvement with Mr. Komi, but as of the 6th volume it is a rare person who does not join the list "Can friends?"\n\xc2\xa0Ridge Mine None (Onegumi Nene)\n\xc2\xa0Mr. Ridpei is a sister.\n\xc2\xa0A nice person with good intercourse and noticeable surroundings. I am worried about what Mr. Tomodan who is prone to be pushed to work something and Mr. Kotomi who can not speak well with others well. A special person in a sense in Isui High School. Mr. Komi and Tono-kun, who are precisely observing the emotions that they are not conscious of, as well as Mr. Kotomi declaring to support the progress of relationship with Tadano-kun is the only person in the present situation. Because of the character which is used for last name in Okaji with Okoji often there are many activities together with the preparation of the cultural festival, and even in the comics it is called Ozio at Combi. Even during the play, you will get called "Frog" and call it by name.\n\xc2\xa0Kaede Oka (Maple Frog)\n\xc2\xa0Mr. Ozuki is getting along.\n\xc2\xa0An annual group festival executive committee member. I am late for the conversation around me because of the conversation tempo that I decided at my own pace, but it is fortunate that the conversation is established properly if it is Mr. Kotomi. During the preparations for the cultural festival, I went to buy with Mr. Komi and Mr. Mine, and I made friends with them. Especially telling us that he wanted to be friends by seeing Mr. Tomoda who is in contact with Tomono-kun and familiar. I am truly ambassador, but in fact it is quite thoughtful ... a person who might be.\n\xc2\xa0In the former times in the volunteering volcanic festival, the name was "baby", but in the old book friend book of extra volume rolls the name was "vermillion". ref (Ogashima) / Kishi Himeko (Kishi)\n\xc2\xa0A group of girls who often take action together with Yamai, joined the list "Will you be friends?" With bonus bonus. Onigashima is a red fancy short fur hide whose kiba always looks at Kishibara. The shore is often in the classroom wearing gloves like iron armor and iron shoes for some reason, something else wears and something wears out and the face can not be seen all the time. The name "Himeko" turned out in the old-fashioned friend\'s book on the bonus extra page.\n\n\xc2\xa0Boys\n\xc2\xa0Shigeishi Shimao (Shigeru Shigarai) / Mr. Sonoda (That\'s good) / Shinano Oshino (Shinobi\'s)\n\xc2\xa0A group of men who are often with the Yamai group (from Toneno it was collectively referred to as "Ike \'s group of classes").

Body size is also big and muscular, feared from the majority of classes. However, in reality, it is difficult to go to school because of the first week of college entrance, I could not come to school until mid-semester since anxiety, I dyed my hair and trained my body so that I can not lick it Basically, it is "community disease" as well. Think of the essence of yourself at the first look and recognize friends as a friend who treats things kindly, deepens friendship, as well as Mr. Komi who does not distract herself as "Mr. Comm." I look up to mentor. Even with a bonus bonus "Can you make friends?" Naru is joining the list "Will you be a disciple?" List, an unusual classmate closer to Mr. Tomono than Mr. Komi.\n\xc2\xa0Other classes / grade\n\xc2\xa0Ami Miura (garbage)\n\xc2\xa0Itami high school library commissioner.

Affection for her daughter is a drowning level.\n\xc2\xa0Hideko Komi (Komi Shuuko)\n\xc2\xa0A glass mother. Like a daughter, there is a feeling of intimidation when it looks at elegance in appearance, but it has a sense of friendly and friendly personality.

In "Big comic" (Shogakkan), serializing from the year. "IBUKI" is also the ship name of the fictitious escort ship DDV of the aircraft carrier construction concept of a fictitious Maritime Self Defense Force appearing in the works. The talk number count is "nth sortie."\n\n\xc2\xa0Work explanation\nPrior to this announcement, with the rise of the People\'s Republic of China (hereinafter referred to as "China"), with particular emphasis on the collision of the Senkaku Islands Chinese fishing boat of the year and the incident of violation of the Senkaku Islands Chinese shipping territories that occur sporadically, The possibility of remote island defense and recaptation strategy was realistic. In addition, the Abe Cabinet, which was born by the change of government during the year, aimed at establishing a peace and security legislation, and discussions were held in the National Assembly. This work which was announced in such era background is a military work which is good at Kawaguchi Kaiji known as "Fleet of Silence" "Zipang Manga Zipangu", but among the works he once published, the reality It has become more rich and concrete.\n\nIn this work, the main theme is how to cope with the imminent situation by overcoming the difference between the captain of the new type escort ship and the deputy captain\'s thought and creed, the part that is mutually recognizable and not so, . Also, as was the case in "Fleet of Silence", politicians of various countries including Japan and China in the field of international politics are also depicted with reality than sfn-hob locwist. On the other hand, there are some parts that are incompatible with the real world (see military unnatural points below) about the operation method of the unit and depiction of weapons.\n\nThe age setting is said to be "XX year" (the next year is "XY Year"). In the scene of XX, "From the start of the SDF (Year) to the Year" sfn volume loc First sortie is said to have been spoken, so if we think that there is no difference between before and after, it will start from the year.\n\n\xc2\xa0Synopsis\nXX Year, the agent efnnamekousakuin, who seems to have been disguised as a victim in the storm, landed on the Minami-Kojima in the Senkaku Islands and claimed that "This island is a territory unique to China and waits for vessels in Mainland China" "Senkaku Islands Chinese landing case" to occur. Furthermore, the collision between the ship of the Chinese maritime police station and the Japan Coast Guard patrol boat which intrudes into the territorial waters of Japan, the escalating warning shooting and the situation to the destroyer dispatched for investigation purpose, the Japanese government inferior to China The prime minister who aimed at collecting the situation, but who felt a sense of crisis in the actions of China decided to move forward with the "Pegasus plan", which pils the creation of a new escort ship and the creation of a new escort group with its ship as flagship .\n\nYear after the incident, effectively "IBUKI" which is the first aircraft carrier aircraft carrier of the SDF is completed. Ryuta Akitsu is appointed to the captain as a former Air Self Defense Force ace pilot Ryuta Ryuta is a vice captain and voyage chief Ninba Shiya Nishi is chosen by the efn SDF customs of the US Navy, Traditionally the former pilot has been appointed captain of the aircraft carriers, Akitsu was expecting himself to be appointed. However, in fact, even in the US Navy, before becoming the captain of the aircraft carrier, you become the deputy general of another ship, the captain, etc, and it is usual to have experience in navigating the warship sfn volume loc first sortie. . The self-defense officers are military personnel, and Shinwa who is proud of the SDF\'s acting in exclusive defense and life first in response to the policy of Akitsu, which is willing to exercise force or to live in the unlikely event On the other hand, he acknowledged his efforts, the ability to organize his subordinates, and continued voyeering in various places while avoiding showing antidiences.\n\nNext XY Year, during the exercise voyage of "IBUKI" off the coast of Minamitorishima, the Chinese army invokes the "Shogaku process", suddenly starts invasion into Japan. The Japanese government, which saw that the Sakishima islands were forbidden and saw the first SDF war dead in addition to the fact that there was no room for discussion in China, the Japanese government, under the direction of Prime Minister Keiichiro Tarumi, to maritime security action Continue to lower defense action for the first time in history. At this point, armed conflict between the SDF and the People\'s Liberation Army of China will be inevitable.\n\n"IBUKI" express fly to the front line, but China responded quickly to the defense launch, and had the new aircraft carriage "Guangdong" headed to the Sakishima Islands. The negotiations between the Japanese and Chinese governments broke down, and finally the action of territory recruitment operation "Hayabusu" was exercised by exercise of ability.\n\n\xc2\xa0Character \n\xc2\xa0main character \n\xc2\xa0Read Kana Ryuta Akitsu Akidori Ryota\n\xc2\xa0hero.

There is only one effect per person, and when the shooter dies, the effect disappears.

"Weekly Shonen Jump" (Shueisha) It is serializing from the year. Abbreviation is about Neva, Nevalain.\n\n\xc2\xa0Story\n\xc2\xa0GF House Prison Breakage (First episode)\nOrphanage \xc2\xb7 Grace Fieldhouse is where various orphans gather. Isabella loved as an orphanage sister "Mama", and siblings also have no blood relationship, but lived happily. There, he raised children leaving the baby by special study and test, continuing to send to the foster parent during the period from the age to the age.\n\nSince foster parents were found and Connie who decided to leave the outside world left behind a doll, Emma who is a hero\'s excellent physical ability and Norman who is superior in intelligence decided to deliver it. But the two witness the moment when Connie is shipped as meat in the "gate" which was forbidden to approach. Two people who knew the existence of "Onimono" from there, don, Dildo and Gilda in addition to knowledgeable Rei in the rear list, start a jailbreak plan from the house.\n\nAmong them, Emma confirmed that Grace Fieldhouse is a "human breeding ground" like a prison. Although preparing for jailbrok was started there, "Sister" was dispatched as an increased supervisor, and it was discovered that Ray was a spy of Mama (Isabella). While various psychological warfare is spreading, it is specified that there is a target to try jailbreak, but Norman will proceed with the plan by the opposite of Isabella\'s desire to maintain management to the last.\n\nChildren who have a temporary cooperative relationship with Sister who plans to kick Isabella aiming for "Mama" seat. But Sister shipped, Isabella also found a preview of jailbreak. Emma \'s legs are folded to seal the plan and further Norman\' s shipment is told.\n\nRay and Emma will disable Norman\'s transmitter and make a strategy to keep all of them out of jailbreak. However, Norman is afraid of hindrance to the jailbreak of children left behind and will come back after forcibly pretending with the transmitter kept alive. According to the memory of infants and the preliminary examination of the death of Ray\'s residents, it turned out that the bridge connected to the headquarters was the only outlet on the cliffs around the house, but Norman\'s shipment was definite. Norman leaves behind the house, leaving Emma who is sorrowful. And finally the day Lei is shipped. Ray made the house a fire, concentrate security on the house and escape from the bridge. And Ray tries to burn with himself, both the luxury goods before the shipment and the house. Emma stopped it and decided to jailbreak, based on Norman\'s message.\n\n\xc2\xa0Minerva search (episode)\nOnce it ran away, if it escaped it was said to be a bridge in front of the headquarters, but decided to move using a hanger and string from the point with the shortest distance to the opposite shore. I will successfully jailbreak successfully by that method, and leave the house.\n\nBut just after jailbreak, siblings other than Emma, \xe2\x80\x8b\xe2\x80\x8bRay and Thomas disappeared. Actually it fell into the invitation hole of a man-made tree. And people fell in the pitfalls, they were driven to the moving roots of the eating tree, came to a dead end, became a crisis of absolute despair, but adventure books written with "PROMISE" and Morse code, "Ugo adventure The story of "Serpent of Alva Pinella" in "The Alva Pinella snake" has a clue to solve, successfully escaped successfully. After escape, someone who is a lower species of demon chase after to eat. It was out of the main line to deal with it by Ray and was chased by lower species. In addition, a pursuer who knocks down the lower species and is an operator of the plantation finally arrived.\n\nMeanwhile, the main force is invited by a mysterious girl. Ray was also aided by a mysterious figure. The name of the girl was musika, and the man who helped Ray was named Sonju. Both of them are demons, but they were societical heretics who do not eat humans for religious reasons. From Seongju he heard that demons have existed from long ago, demons hunt people, people were killing demons, but the world\'s living division was proposed by a person who keeps one owl, that promise Continued even now, I learned that Emma were descendants of those left in the world of demons. Furthermore, although it is said that it is impossible to go back and forth between the world, it turned out that the person crossed over to the world of demons in order to supply products for farmers to demons. And Sonju and Mujica went on to a further journey, so Emma went separately to go to the destination. However, Sonju actually believed in the original faith that he would not eat other than life born naturally, he was eager to eat the descendants of Emma.\n\nLater, Emma arrived at the target point, but there was nothing in the ground. So when I started up the pen, a map was displayed and the entrance opened. There was an underground shelter in Minerva, and there was one guest ahead. He was also led here by the pen, but because of its reasonable nature he threatened Emma to a pistol and to leave the shelter. But when Emma got a counterattack, he fainted by emitting mysterious words. Also on the wall of the shelter were letters of poetry and letters of HELP scribbling.\n\n\xc2\xa0View of the world \nThe story begins with a farm named Grace Fieldhouse (an orphanage facing upright) where breeders raise human beings as edible livestock, which the heroes run by tribes calling "demons".\n\nThe era setting is the year when the story began and it was confirmed that the book was published by humans in the outside world at least until the year from the information obtained in the plantation, Information that there are human beings is coming out as information. According to the story of Songju, there were no farms in the former world, demons were attacking human beings to live, but some people are subject to demons, or they dislike demons and armed and eaten There were also people who kill over the number of demons. When humans pointed to endless killings and endless fears each other was disgusted, the proposal was made from the human side "human beings do not hunt demons, so demons do not hunt humans and divide each other world". This "promise" is the beginning of everything, which cuts the world into one of the human world and the demon world, thus breaking one world. Emma \'s ancestors were souvenirs left at that time in the demon\' s world, demons kept promises, managed man at the plantation, continued farming. For nearly a year since the promise, the world has not changed especially, it is impossible to go back and forth between each other\'s world.\n\nFor the reasons mentioned above, although the possibility of human beings other than farmland in the demon world where Emma lives is very low, the person equal to demons that Krone looked at the headquarters came from the human world Be human. Also, many of the things that are donated to the house are made in the human world, and it is presumed that William Minerva is a person who is traversing each other\'s world.\n\nDetails on the location of Grace Fieldhouse are unknown, but it is estimated that it is a mid latitude region in the Northern Hemisphere during the work. Also, the world map that comes out in the works is the same as the real thing, but the fact that Europe is the stage, such as being drawn mainly in Europe and the language used by the characters being English There are many depictions that show that there is something. However, there are still many mysteries, such as translating "PROMISE" to the Japanese promise. In addition, although it is said that the world of demons and the world of human beings are being disconnected in the process, it is known that the stage being under construction is the earth and the above calendar is correct.\n\nAlthough the original forest seems to be spreading around the Grace Fieldhouse, in fact the colonies of the blood-sucking trees are spreading, and the wild devil with poor intelligence called the lower grade of the wild from the demon of the plantation There are also many animals and plants that do not exist in the original Earth\'s ecosystem, such as being found. However, not all animals and plants are such things, plants and animals and plants exist.\n\nThe point B where we reached with relying on the pen is not even marked in the middle of the wilderness, but if a shelter exists in the basement and the pen is used to satisfy the condition, the entrance will appear. Shelter is made with advanced technology, electricity and water etc are not inconvenient for living normally, so there are also fields so self-sufficiency is possible environment. Although there was no William Minerva in the shelter, letters are left, and if it aims at the place of residence, it is stated as heading to point A. The shelter seems to have been a man living with a fellow from a farm named Glorybell a year ago and a man seems to have headed with a group at point A in the past, but details are unknown, but in that case My friends are annihilating. According to a man, it seems necessary to pass the demon\'s living area to reach point A, and it is a danger zone which is not comparable with the wild forest around the farm and the wilderness around the shelter. There is a forest which is the colonial place of the demons of Nara, and there are something like the tree trunk like a stone and something like a candle melted in the way, it seems to be quite different from the house forest.\n\n\xc2\xa0characters \n\xc2\xa0main character \n\xc2\xa0Emma\n\xc2\xa0The main character of this work.

The identification number is. Hair color Orange Eye color Emerald green\nFull score in daily test. High athletic ability. Compared to Norman and Ray it is rather optimistic personality. One day living with the children of the house one day, Conney\'s forgotten thing, Little Barney was delivered, and I decided to go to the gate I should not go. However, by seeing the moment of Connie\'s "shipment" there, we will know the truth of the house which was regarded as an orphanage. She adds Norman, Ray, and Don, Gilda to allies and aims at jailbreak with all the children to the last.\nHowever, after grasping the whole area of \xe2\x80\x8b\xe2\x80\x8bthe plantation, in addition to the fact that the degree of jailbreak difficulty is much higher than the previous assumption, Norman also disappeared and the idea was revised by asking Gilda about the children of other plants , Leave children under the age who will not be shipped for a while, switch to a plan to jailbreak with only children over the age. However, I did not give up on the jailbreak of children under the age and I pledge to rescue children of all plants within the year and refuse to refrain from children in ref Rey is surprised by my inner heart with "I\'m crushing this farm?" ref. Tell Phil the truth of the house and leave it after.\nA man of \'seniors\' who met at a shelter at B pointed to a distinctive flight splashing hair so that it could be nicknamed "Antennae", and in march of extra edition mama tries to cut its hair, but hair Because it avoids scissors, it can not cut.\n\xc2\xa0Norman\n\xc2\xa0One of the oldest orphan.

Hair color Cream Yellow Eye color Ice blue\nI went to deliver Little Barney with Emma, \xe2\x80\x8b\xe2\x80\x8bbut I saw the moment of shipment. And, in collaboration with Emma, \xe2\x80\x8b\xe2\x80\x8bRei aim for jailbreak. I understand the difficulty of jailbreak by all children in the house including the infant, but I am daring to aim to make Emma \'s hope of fulfilling his favor. It is superior to the most rational and psychological bargaining among the children, but since all of Ray which should be the most friendly ally deny deserpation, he must also trade with him and is struggling hard thinking.\nSuddenly it is decided to be shipped before the age of his birthday and it is suggested to lurk in the garden from Emma and Ray until the day until the jailbreak, but after revealing the jailbreak it appears again and the information gained outside Leave to people. The feeling of wanting to live was strong, but accept no shipment, so no one will die but will not lose in the unlikely event.\nRay\n\xc2\xa0One of the oldest orphan. An old boy. Born on the date. Height cm. A well-knowledgeable readingist with full score. The identification number is. Hair color Black eyes Colored dark brown\nLater I can tell you about Jailbreak from Norman, but in fact I knew about demons from early childhood, and I was tuggering with moms while staying inside. In transactions as "collaborators", we requested "grand prix" (goods not normally available) and "old shipment" at the age, but the real purpose lies in escaping Emma, \xe2\x80\x8b\xe2\x80\x8bNorman . It is realism, giving up young children and claiming to escape only the elders, but Emma will not break and cooperate on the surface. But I am not convinced with my inner heart.\nI knew about demons from the time they were born, and since I did not have childhood amnesia that should have happened normally, I had to know the whole thing. Isabella\'s real child, since there was a memory from the time of his fetus, Isabella learns that Ray is her child by singing Leslie\'s song he heard when he was in the belly of Isabella.\nActually I do not like studying or reading much, but I endured patience and study while reading to increase my own worth to the utmost. Even trying to make a revenge of Reya\'s revenge and brothers\' jailbreak opportunity, saying that he suffered oil and burned suicide and took himself as the best treat just before harvest, Norman Will be reported to Emma immediately prior to shipment of Ray\'s suicide and plan to use it. A fire of fire in the house which felt as if Lei committed suicide by Emma is done, and jailbreak is decided.\nIn Norman\'s plan, when jailing by way of crossing a cliff with a rope without going through a bridge, embrace Jemima that he can not do it because he is scared and finish crossing the cliff together. At that time, if you survive outside without killing anyone, you will have the idea of \xe2\x80\x8b\xe2\x80\x8bpursuing your ideals.\nWhen jailing the house, unlike Emma, \xe2\x80\x8b\xe2\x80\x8bit seems that the ear has been incised and the transmitter has been taken out, and later the injury of the ear recovers to a state that is OK without gauze.\nMy nickname attached from a man of "seniors" who I met at the B shelter is "losing one-eyed sleep."

The identification number is.\nCompared to Normans, there are places that are somewhat short-circuited and inferior in ability to judge situations, but feelings of thinking about brothers are strong. He seemed to care about Connie and he helped him well. Initially, it was reported that escape from human trafficking from Norman "to escape trafficking", but later I learned the fact of the demon.\nAfter knowing the fact of the demon, he will support Emma as a sub leader of the jailbreak team with Gilda. I do not put out much on the table, but I care about the two people, such as Emma and Ray\'s worrying about crying when danger comes close.\nMy nickname attached from a man of "seniors" who I met at the B shelter is "bean noppo."

The identification number is.\n\xc2\xa0Being fashionably interested and before being taken over by the jailbreak plan, he was lamenting that the clothing provided by the house is White Dragon. The result of the test at the time of the talk is the only point table next to the oldest person. A talented woman with excellent insight and calm thought though not as good as Norman. Before being taken over by the jailbreak plan, I was aware of the fact that brothers and sisters "getting out of the house" are out of communication and the change in the behavior of Emma before the plan, and the presence of Mama\'s secret room (radio room) And I located the place.\n\xc2\xa0After knowing the fact of the demon, he will support Emma as a sub leader of the jailbreak team with Don. When Emma and Ray are absent (when you meet Mojika, when you go to a reconnaissance from a shelter in B), it becomes a leader substitute.\n\xc2\xa0The nickname attached from a man of "seniors" who met at a shelter at B site is "Katabutz round glasses".

The identification number is.\nEmma informs us of the truth of the house, but from the meaning of the word "harvest" that Krone said in the game of tags and the state of the emma so far, I felt that something horrible things had happened before It was. In addition, it is told that Emma is troubled with jailbreak by all, leaving behind age or under jailbreak, Under the age of 9, even if the earliest birthday child can explain that harvest can be postponed for the minimum year and a half When it is done, I propose to leave because I can wait and undertake later as a person who knows the truth of the only house among children under the age.\nSherry\n\xc2\xa0Old girl.

From the fact that she was "shipped", Emma knew the existence of a demon and the truth of the house. The identification number is.\nMark\nAn old boy. I like to eat. I am on good terms with Naira. The identification number is.\nWhen I met a man who was in the shelter trusted by relying on a pen, the other children are pretending to be drinking tea with a broken cup, a bad behavior of the man who might be Minerva, a dress of clothes While focusing on places that are not the case, consciousness was concentrating on the cookie the man is eating.\nNaira\nOld girl.

It acts very gentle to children, but on the other hand it manages the human farm as a cruel hand of the demon (Mama). The identification number is.\nIt is excellent as "Mama" but she makes a mistake that Emma knows the actual condition of the farm. I used Ray as a guard from a childhood. I hope to keep shipping while maintaining the current management system, and will fight psychological warfare with Norman. In work, it is confirmed that a book was published by humans in the outside world at least until the year, According to Krone, even Isabella which was born before that was born and raised in a farm .\nAccording to the reminiscence of "Grandma", there is a description climbing the wall to know the secret of the farm and to jailbreak when he was a child. Also, in Isabella\'s own recollections, I saw that around the farm was a high cliff at that time, seems to have given up jailbreak ref Refrey seems to have learned the secret of the plantation after the factory was shipped It is unknown whether he knew with such circumstances. ref.\n\xc2\xa0As I was a child I saw how I felt favorable to Leslie who was in the same plant, the reason why I chose to aim for mommy was that I was eaten at least if I was not able to change anything about Leslie\'s being killed. I wanted to continue living as a human being.\n\xc2\xa0It was the mother of Ray Fruit who was listening to the fetus who had lost the song Leslie made, but one day Ray knew that Ray is his child by singing that song.\n\xc2\xa0I got my ropes used for jailbreak by Emma \'s success in jailbreak and accepted my loss, I hoped there was light in the place where emma who escaped from prison goes.\n\xc2\xa0It is unclear about the future of Isabella, but according to the comment which seems to have drawn the state of the current philosophies, phils move to a new dormitory and women who are different from Isabella are taking care of Phils is drawn At this time it is unknown whether the dormitory is a newly built building or a lodging of another plant. Also, it is unknown at this time whether this woman is a breeding supervisor or an assistant. ref.\nSister Krone Sister\n\xc2\xa0Assistant dispatched from the headquarters at the request of Isabella to strengthen monitoring. age. Height cm. She is also a devil \'s man. I am from a plant different from the plant where Emma is located. The identification number is.\nKnowing Isabella\'s mistake, I grab the evidence and let Isabella go down from the seat of "Mama", and plan to rob the position. In the process I built a cooperative relationship with the children in a comprehensive cooperation, but I was planning to ship the obstructive children in battle after the Isabella was destroyed. But Isabella judged her as finished, he was killed and shipped dead in such a way as to be defeated by power struggle.\nAs I said before, I have never had a good feeling for my children, but I feel strong aversion to Isabella looking down on me more than that, so let the children succeed jailbreak "I want you to destroy the world that looks like a shit," leaving behind a "clue to fatal information" about Isabella before being unwillingly shipped.\nDear Mr Grandma Ma\n\xc2\xa0It is a person in the position to oversee multiple plants, which seems to be the boss of the Isabella family breeding ref. It is unknown at the present time whether the Grandma is a person or multiple people. I highly appreciate Isabella\'s skill and I am counting on the plant that she manages. At present, the appearance above the nose is blurred, details such as age are unknown.\nIt seems that Isabella was doing her "mama" at a farm at a childhood, there was a description depicting Isabella at that time knew the secret of the plantation, but there was a depiction that was jailbroken, but that was also within the hands of "Grandma" It seems. It is suggested that Isabella \'s policy that Isabella\' s policy that it is good to control shipping even if edible children are informed of the secret of the plantation is the same as "Grandma" which was once her "Mama".\nDelivery ogre\'s demon\n\xc2\xa0Demon that delivered Connie. It is connected with Isabella.\nAttendees of the mysterious demon meeting\n\xc2\xa0I participate in a conference where demons who are supposed to be attached to important post gather. I talk about Isabella\'s farm. I think the top of the demon is precious.\nDemon\'s top (temporary)\nPresence being sacred from demons. Although there is a notation with the character which seems to be original ogre, the reading method is unknown. It seems that it is not such a name that humans can not pronounce, as Krone can pronounce it.\nDemon of followers\nA demon of human type who came to bring Emma who escaped from the plantation. The name is unknown. He had a fairly high fighting ability, such as making a wild lower species demon with a single blow and making two big trees, but all of them were killed by Songju including beast-shaped demons who are subordinates.\nSir Bayon\nA nobleman\'s ogre, the Lord of secret hunting ground in Goldie pound. It seems to have authority to receive edible children from the plantation alive in a living condition, freeing edible children in a secret private garden in the farm, and providing human hunting to other aristocrats.\nGrand Duke of Lewis\nA demon of nobility. I put a demon like a small monkey on my shoulder. It is a secret hunting guest and aimed by a strong human being who is going to kill, but recently he has not met such a person and is bored and does not show interest in frightening prey. It seems to be living more than a year, I miss the hunting which lived the life of former human beings and demons, and owner of the idea that hunting is interesting because hunting is mutually afraid of life. I was interested in Emma who attacked with an aim with a single ax with no hesitation to the nobility ogres who brought the squirrel who underwent a mild hunt and set the aim for Emma. She seems to have hunted a shelter man and his associates, and people like Emma have been since then.\nDemons with followers\nA demon of nobility. At the moment the name is unknown. It is a secret hunting guest, not particularly concerned with the prey, I think that if it is okay to hunt it would like to overrun the small fish. With a dusky personality, if you give a person to an edible child a proposal is made that others can escape, but at that time Emma will be aimed at his eyes with an ax but escaped the hardship that is assisted by the Grand Duke of Lewis.\n\n\xc2\xa0Other characters\nWilliam Minerva\nOwner of many books donated to Grace Fieldhouse. At the moment, it is unknown what kind of person it is, but I leave a message through books and pens. It is speculated that it is a person who is coming and going between the human world and the demon world.\nLeslie\nA boy whose Isabella was in the same plant as a child. She has a quiet personality but has a talent for making songs, and she asked Isabella to listen to her own songs. Although ref details shipped later are unknown, it seems that it is due to expire because it can be seen that it was born earlier than Isabella from the recognition number. ref. The identification number is.\nIsabella seemed to like him, after learning the truth of House Leslie songs were said to have been strong, but as Rei was singing Leslie\'s song one day, Isabella says that Ray I know that I am my own child.\nMusica\nA demon girl who helped Emma. The physique is similar to a human girl and has a figure that is relatively close to humans.\nFor religious reasons we do not eat humans, we have a custom similar to humans, such as praying by pairing hands before eating. According to Songju, the musika seems not to have eaten or to eat humans, but as to why it is not necessary to eat, it is unknown at this time. At the beginning of helping Emma, \xe2\x80\x8b\xe2\x80\x8bI was not so interested in Emma, \xe2\x80\x8b\xe2\x80\x8bbut my emotions shifted as I was in contact with Emma, \xe2\x80\x8b\xe2\x80\x8band I gave Emma a happy book, such as telling me some advice on my part when we separate. I hope with my heart.\nSongju\nA demon man who helped Ray. It is never as big as a demon, but has a bigger physique than a general human.\nLike mujika humans do not eat for religious reasons, but they seem to eat anything else, it is heresy in demon \'s society as well. According to his remarks, there seems to have been called "demon" in the past, because I wanted to talk to humans after a long time with a simple interest that I helped Ray. But the real purpose of helping Emma was to break Emma promises made before the year, even if they could not break promises, Emma bore children in the demon world, outside It aims to have people living in the world increase. The original faith that Sungju believes in seems not to be rebellion against God if it gets the life that God created in the form of hunting, if eaten if it is a natural person who was born and raised outside the plantation I am anxious and I\'d like to eat a full-bodied human again.\nAfter breaking up with Emma, \xe2\x80\x8b\xe2\x80\x8bI killed all the demons of the pursuers who are the hindrance to make my dream come true.\nPeople who keep owls\nWe suggested division of demons and the world of humans. Because there are owls also in the mark of the book of William Minerva, it is thought that there is some relation.\nShelter\'s man (temporary)\nA man who met at a shelter where Emma got to rely on a pen. At the moment the name is unknown. A former edible boy from a plantation called Glorybell. In the meaning of escaped edible baby, it corresponds to Emma \'s "seniors". There is an identification number in the stomach, but a character string is described unlike Grace Field.\nYears ago I rely on a pen with my colleagues to escape from the farm and I arrived at the shelter to meet Minerva, though I thought that Minerva did not seem to show up, but I thought it was a lie, but water , Food, electricity and living space are all present, thanks to the underground shelter which has information and materials about the world. However, all the members are dead, saying that they learned to eliminate waste as a technique to survive during the year, and now they have stopped searching Minerva with the opinion that all of their friends, hopes and emotions are useless. I know that Emma is a person who is from Grace Fieldhouse and has escaped in front of the day and shows how the neck identification number is from Graysfield, but as to the reasons for knowing other details at the present moment It is unknown. Shelter\'s resources are limited, shelter claims to be his home who came earlier, let Emma take the gun to the hostage, leave the pen and leave it to choose to die here .\nEmma was banging his money and gun fire as he ran away. However, it seems that they are not actually going to kill Emma, \xe2\x80\x8b\xe2\x80\x8band it seems that they are about to volunteer to go out to the last, such as shooting by guns with a menacing criterion and not really shooting. Looking at the state of Emma, \xe2\x80\x8b\xe2\x80\x8bI will overlap with my past myself, but suddenly fall into a state of confusion and faint. While stunned, they are restrained by being wrapped in cloth or something with the kids on something. Moreover, it seems that the rest of the cookie which I was eating was eaten by children.\nAfter that, I solved the restraint that Emma had done by oneself and came out of the room. According to Emma, \xe2\x80\x8b\xe2\x80\x8bthe man actually does not care about the limit of the resources in the shelter, it seems that the sole of the shoe is worn down and the belly is also tightened frequently appearing on the ground, The tree nuts that can not be made in the field were suspended. Also, it seems that the skill of the gun is intentionally hurting and removing the leather of the Emma, \xe2\x80\x8b\xe2\x80\x8band the place where the fruit can be collected is a danger zone where there may be a demon\'s nest such as a forest and waterside, etc. High fighting ability It seems to have. Although details are unknown at this time, preference of cooking and drinking tea which had been done at the beginning of the appeared seems to be related to "tea ceremony" to say by Emma. For men shelter seems to be more important than just a facility, Emma requested Minerva search guide and bouncer in exchange for an emergency destroyer, under the condition that neither leading nor escorting nor living to the last Accept Emma \'s request.\nThe man does not teach the name to Emma, \xe2\x80\x8b\xe2\x80\x8band he does not concern as much as possible with calling with Emma who appointed Emma \'s things appropriately as well. Some children are shocked by the miscellaneous names of men assigned to men, but only the nut called "nose" is a little satisfied Feeling ref nuts are regarded as somewhat narcissistic personality, and their own nose muscles It seems to be beautiful and proud ref. Many things in the shelter seem to be valuable to men, so even if Alicia raised a broken tea cup miscellaneously, it is upset. The man tells little about the events that happened in the past, but he admits that Emma is a good family. However, I feel that it is an eyesore because it is a good family, and I want you to disappear. The details are unknown, but there seems to be experience in the past towards point A in the past, everything goes crazy with one judgment, my ideals and judgments resulted in my friend being killed.\nIn the lead to the point A, it was rushing through the wilderness as fast as the ema \'s arrive. The guy is still evaluating that Emma \'s legs are slow when it is late, and it is an evaluation that it is late for internal meditation, but seems to be evaluating accordingly as to what is being followed. Emma and Ray people are particularly troublesome in regaining the shelter, and Giruda feels it is troublesome as well, and as Giruda says she will blow up the shelter if people die, either Emma or Ray I\'m thinking of getting dead. In the field of demons of Nara, they attack the demons that attacked Emma from above with guns, but let them play without compromising themselves, calling out their fellows, and gathering angry group of demons of stray. A man says that he will save him when he dies, but from a place away from him, he shows high ability such as detaining difficult demons from behind. I saw Emma \'s escape out of demon\' s territory by himself, and it seems that he acknowledged Emma \'s things a little though.\nAccording to the reminiscence of a man\'s dream, it was the man himself who invented what all the other members of the group headed to point A in the past, at that time the companion wiped out. The small vest worn by a man used to be worn by a fellow, and the details are unknown, but it seems that this best also brought home when she ran away to shelter. A man is driven by self-esteem that he has the cause of the annihilation of his companion, and it seems that his heart is burning when I see his eyes full of hope of Emma. The man seems to have reached point A alone afterwards, so it seems that he knew one route not on the map, he went back and came back.\nOnce a man was able to survive in the extinction of his friends, because their friends have escaped the guy, Emma \'s desperate persuasion that Emada\' s desperate persuasion can lead to a change in the mind I told Emma about the dangers at point A and asked me to turn back at once. Immediately after that Emma was caught by the intelligence demon and taken away to point A. The man stops Lei who is trying to chase Emma and runs away from the place. The man and his colleagues seemed to have been taken to the intellectual demon in the past to the goldie pound and know the fear of the intelligence demon, persuading Ray to give up Emma by saying that he is too javely. As mentioned earlier, a man has changed his mind and is unwilling to harm Emma, \xe2\x80\x8b\xe2\x80\x8band if Emma can help it, he wants to help but it seems to be impossible.\nNicholas\nA boy who was a male member of a shelter. He was covered with a hat.\nJohn\nA boy who was a male member of a shelter. The vest worn by a man originally seems to be what he was wearing.\nDyna\nA girl who was a member of a shelter man. He was wearing a headband.\nLucas\nA boy who was a male member of a shelter.\nGoldie-pound boy (temporary)\nA boy in a secret hunting ground in Goldie Pound. At the moment the name is unknown. I know details of the hunting ground and it seems to know things about the farm.\n\n\xc2\xa0Glossary\ndemon\nTribe who is human beings as food. "Ogre" is a designation that Emma put on for convenience from the appearance, the official name is unknown, and Krone calls "people", "guys" and so on. In addition, the shelter man calls "human eat".\nAlthough details are unknown at this moment, it seems that even among demons there is a class, and children shipped from the farm where Emma are located are the luxury goods that can not be eaten absolutely at the bottom of the demon. It seems that the highest existence is sacred.\nAlthough there are differences in appearance and physique between individuals, many demons suffer from horn masks whose eyes are vertically aligned, and fingers are books. Details are unknown, but the actual demon\'s face has countless things like eyes, which is different from the number of eyes of the mask. Also, the eyes (or eyes themselves) around the center of the face seems to be weak points, and seems to cover a mask to protect them. Some people have physically no difference from humans or adults with one hand.\nDemon itself seems to have various kinds, and there are people of human type and those of beast type According to Rejska, the figure of demons has become disordered during the years ref. There were some nose-friendly types in the beast type, and we knew the direction Emma left outside the plantation and the direction he ran away. Details are unknown, but it seems that people of human type are higher in rank than beast type.\nAccording to the conversation of the demons, there seems to be some who eats cats, but it seems to be treated like a getaway even from a demon.\nThere is a rule that we do ceremonies when slaughtering prey, not limited to humans, and we can eat meat that has finished the ceremony.\nThere seems to be no control of all human beings, there are people who are in equal contact with demons, and the fact that human society exists in the outside world is touched as information. However, according to Sueju\'s remarks, people who lived today today can only see you inside the farm, and it is speculated that people equal to demons are human beings from the human world.\nIt has a creepy appearance but can speak human language and has a depiction that keeps humans as domesticated animals and has technological capabilities equal to or better than human beings, and forms an advanced society It can be seen. There is also a demon which seems not to belong to the demon society called the lower grade of the wild from the demon of the farm to the outside world, but unlike the demon of the plantation, the word does not speak and intelligence seems to be low is there. There are demons that do not eat humans for religious reasons, but even in demon society it is heretical and it is a minimal number.\nThe battle capability seems to be quite high, the large demon slaughtered with a hand with a high handedness Krone, and the demon who is a follower of Emma who escaped disabled the Naruse demon which is the lower class without difficulty. However, in the conflict between former human beings and demons, the demon side did not seem to have been dominant, and the number of demons more than those who devoiced were killed by human beings.\nAlthough concrete things about life expectancy are unknown, Sonju seems to have eaten human in the past, but since the world is severed before years ago, there is a possibility of eating humans before that. In addition, in the plan of Sonju, even if it was impossible to break promises a year ago to Emma, \xe2\x80\x8b\xe2\x80\x8bconsider breeding in the world of demons, eating natural persons who were born and raised outside the plantation However, it can be said that it is considerably longer than human beings because it takes more than several decades to realize it. According to the remake of the Grand Duke of Lewis, it is like a tribe that is able to live more than a year, because he misses the era when he was hunting for life with human beings.\nThe reason is unknown at this moment, but the wilderness around the shelter dislikes the ogre and does not come close, so according to Songju, as long as he is walking in the wilderness there is no thing to come across a demon.\nThere is a forest which is the colony of the demons of Nara in the way to the point A, but basically all species are rough and always moving in groups It is said that there are always companions nearby. If you find a prey you call a friend, there is a habit of shaking prey by striking all at once.\nIt has regenerative ability, and even if it is an ordinary creature it will not die even if it receives an attack that would be fatal. However, when the eyes are attacked, they are killed without playing. Noriki Ogre is not usually exposed to bullets, but as a fellow devil eats the carcasses and erases gun traces as they shoot in one shot, sometimes the flocks full of playing traces are seen from intelligence demons It is obviously abnormal, the shelter \'s man and his colleagues have been captured by the intelligence demons for reasons and have been taken to the Goldie pound at point A in some cases.\nThe intelligence demon who speaks human beings seems to be so dangerous as to be unable to compare with Nara demons, even if she is a man of shelter who does not take on the group of Nara demons as too much.\nCeremony (Guupna)\nIn the way of demon traditional prey slaughter, sting a lucky vegetation plant called Vida with living in the prey \'s breast with gratitude to God. There is a meaning to devote himself to God, when the flower opens it means that God has received and that meat can be eaten. In addition, this work also doubles as a bleeding, which means that meat will last longer.\nRitual (Tifari)\nAlthough details are unknown at this time, it seems that a child with the highest score called the best thing is dedicated as a desk to the top of the demon. According to Grandma \'s remarks, in the year under construction, there are no children other than the plant of Isabella that meets the highest standards, Isabella is expected to "ship" the best ones safely.\nGrace Fieldhouse\nHighest-ranking human farm run by demons. There are all plants, and what Emma are in is the plant in it. I believe that many children, including infants, are orphanages and live. The surroundings of the residential residence are dense forests, and the outer edges are surrounded by walls that can not be climbed by children. Only places called "gates" can contact the outside. It is forbidden to approach the walls and gates, in fact the children are trapped. The management of goods has been thoroughly done, and in particular, handling of the cutlery is tough. Communication facilities are hidden in the room of Mama, and it communicates with "headquarters" such as regular contact. When the children jailbreak, they are reported to the headquarters using communication equipment and the alarm sounds throughout the plantation.\nAccording to Songju, Grace Fieldhouse is one of the few high ranked farms, only high-end farms are present, and most of the farms are mass-produced farms. Therefore, although it is said that the possibility that a person who escaped from the plantation is outside is very low, it seems that there is a demon who steals humans by striking the plantation to the very rare human eating.\nBecause the children of Emma and Grace Fieldhouse have lived an orderly life, I also care about things that are not so important, such as the bad behavior of a man in the shelter that followed the pen and the oddness of dressing of the clothes There seems to be a tendency to be.\nEdible infant\nChildren who are face to face are orphans, but in reality are raised as edible livestock at human farm. In the case of Gracefield, the identification number of the number is written in the neck, but the position of the identification number and the law of the identification number seem to differ depending on the plantation, and in Glory-Belle the letter string is stated in the stomach. Although the details of the recognition number are not specified, in the case of Gracefield, if the numbers are reversed, it is in the order of being born. However, only the luxury farms are identifying and managing individuals. Children develop their brains like demons, face up can be bred fondly with affection. Also, although the height of intelligence is also required, the fear of noticing everyday abnormalities also increases, so the skill of "Mama" is questioned.\nThere are children of all races, born to be births normally at facilities in the headquarters. Children \'s mothers have been found to be candidates for breeding careers. Also, children have depictions born by artificial insemination, but fathers are unknown at this time. Clothing in the farm is white dragon, and some older girls are dissatisfied with clothes.\nRegarding shipping, it is said that face-up is nested with foster parents being arranged, and children who do not know the fact believe so. The age at which children are shipped is shipped in ascending order of scores from the age afterwards and shipped unconditionally at the age of ref It is unknown at this time whether the age is maturing in the farms other than the Grace Field ref. Goldie pound There seems to be edible babies over the age in the secret hunting ground in. ref. However, children who knew the secret have rules to ship immediately. Regarding the pace of shipment, although it is not specified, basically once the shipment is done the next shipment seems to be over a month ahead.\nThe grade of children\'s meat is ranked by the score and age of the test, rank such as "average", "upper thing", "best thing" exists, and the rank is higher as the elderly. Some expressions saying "special" are coming out, Emma and Ray fall under "special". "The best thing" and "the special" seem to have almost the same meaning, but the existence of small differences is unknown at the present time. In addition, under the work, the age is called "down", the age from years old is "average", the age is "\xe4\xbd\xb3", and the age is "upper". It seems that all the old children have already been shipped, and the rank name is unknown.\nThe ancestors of edible children are souvenirs left in the world of demons when the world of human beings and the world of demons were disconnected, and demons are going to plant farms for the purpose of managing and breeding the souvenirs It was established.\nBreeding supervision\nPresence of managing edible children at human farm. The so-called "Mama" ref At present, the details are unknown, but it seems that there are differences depending on the plantation, and it seems to be called "teacher" in the farm where there were people of edible children shipped to Goldie pound. ref. It will be selected from girls older than 10 years old who received more than a certain score in the test, and still received recommendation from the breeding supervisor.\nFor girls who satisfy the above conditions, they are forced to choose between dying or aiming at breeding at the time of shipping, but girls who choose to aim for breeding are buried in the body so that they can not escape from the farm It is a mechanism that the heart stops by electric shock when going out. As there are few seats for breeding supervision and vacant seats are not easily available, there are only a handful of people who can actually be keeper. According to Krone, there are only days in which death is pushed together even after it aims to keep birth, most of whom fall out and ship along the way.\nIn the headquarters survive until becoming an adult in the competition with other candidate breeding birds, appointed as a breeding supervisor or assistant by giving birth and giving birth ability.\nThe reason why breeding supervisors can only be girls is not specified, but it is thought that this is one of the reasons because there is a role of giving birth to children. The human head of the headquarters that controls "Mama" is called "Grandma".\nAssistant\nIn human farming, there is a presence to assist the breeding supervisor. Known as "sister." Like the breeding supervisor, it is appointed in the headquarters to survive until becoming an adult in the competition with other candidate breeding birds, by giving birth to a child and recognizing ability.\nAlthough it is situated next to the breeding superintendent, unlike the breeding supervisor, the plant does not necessarily have assistance, and many of them seem to be in the headquarters.\nDetails are unknown, but there are depictions that women are supposed to assist the care of babies born at headquarters.\nTransmitter\nOne of the key items under construction. A device for managing people as goods. Emma \'s observation proved to be embedded in the ear. Because it is ultra compact, almost no sense of discomfort will arise when growing up. A signal to be transmitted is transmitted as position information to a pocket watch type receiver of "Mama". Although it can not distinguish individuals, it will also notify abnormality if broken. The fact that it is impossible by human science technology at the time of year, such as continuing to move more than years after being embedded in a super small size so that no surgical traces remain, it is said that there is possibility of original technology of demon. Lay creates a device which invalidates the signal from the material of "grand prix" later. I committed to Norman, but it was left unused.\nChip\nA chip embedded in the girl\'s heart who chose to aim for breeding supervision. When going out of the farm, electricity is turned off and the heart is stopped. It is also a transmitter to inform the headquarters when the heart stops due to other factors.\ntest\nIntelligence test done at house every day, highest point. Demons like the human brain and are going for that development. Begin to take tests from age.\nThe difficulty level of the test is high, and it can be seen that it is pretty good if you can get a half correct answer from depiction in the work. The higher the score of the test is, the better it is regarded as the edible meat equivalent to the demon. Conversely, children with lower score are shipped early.\nThe results of the test are not made public except for full marks, but Connie\'s speech has become a hint to the law of shipping. For children other than full marks, assignments (like homework) are issued.\nLittle Burnie\nThe stuffed animal of Connie, the rabbit. After Connie was shipped there was in Mama\'s room, but it was destroyed when the house was burned.\npen\nAt the headquarters, a pen dropped by a man in equal position with a demon. Krone picked it up and entrusted to Emma.\nAt first glance it is just a pen but the initials of WM are written, and when disassembling, a string such as [B] is written in the middle cylinder part. It becomes a projection device, and when pulling one more step, a hologram of moths with Morse code and a character string of [B] emerge in the air.\nA character string such as [B] seems to be coordinates, initially it was speculated that William Minerva is here. According to Emma, \xe2\x80\x8b\xe2\x80\x8bthe house seems to be the starting point and the coordinates of the house are [B]. The first two digits are North and South, the last two digits indicate the east and west coordinates are inferred.\nA Morse code called TOUCH ME (touched on me) is written in the hologram of,, and when it touches, a new code [] appears. Ref However, the encryption itself changes every time ref. This seems to point to the page row line of Minerva\'s book, and when you enter the word HUMAN (human) written there, a message from Minerva appears. If you go to the end, you will get an error if you do not enter the correct answer in the state where you have reached point B, but if you enter correct answer in B, you will see things that seem like maps and an entrance to the underground shelter will emerge.\nAlthough there was no Minerva in the shelter, there is a letter that instructed you to take a pen at point A and head there.\nHeadquarters\nIt is regarded as a facility for raising a human baby as a product. It was speculated that the baby sent to the house has grown to a certain extent and that the transmitter has already been embedded.\nAccording to Ray, Grace Fieldhouse has all plants including the plant where Emma lives, and in addition there is the headquarters. There are many demons and adults in the headquarters.\nAccording to information confirmed by Norman climbing the fence, the plants including the head office are adjacent to each other and the whole shape is hexagonal, its surroundings become cliffs of height which is impossible to jump off ing. The headquarters is located directly opposite the plant and only connected with the bridge. According to depiction in the works, although it is a quite large building compared with the lodging in the plant, unlike the plant, there are not even trees growing in the surroundings rather than the forest.\nHogo adventure story\nA book out of a special book that Minerva left. Morse called promise (promise) is stated, and Marvin of the lemur of the lem and homie of the hero is an adventure story traveling the unexplored world of the world.\nAlthough it seems to be anywhere at first glance, it is a handbook of the outside world, which describes how to deal with odd flora and fauna in the outside world, how to use it.\nVida\nIn the demon world, it is a blood-sucking plant native to everywhere, used for a ceremony to slay prey. Piercing the heart while the prey lives, flowers open by sucking blood. It also has a role of bleeding, which means that meat of prey will last long.\nLuxury farm\nHuman farm keeping human with advanced intelligence. All are present, and at the moment Grace - Field and Glorybell \'s name are known. Among them, Grace-Field is positioned as the highest grade. Identify and manage individuals with identification numbers. Although differences by plantation and plant are unknown at the present moment, basically it has been nurtured healthily in a lively environment, and tests are being conducted to increase intelligence. According to Songju, edible children in mass-produced farms do not have advanced intelligence, so it is only a high-ranking plantation that there is guidance from Minerva. In quality luxury farms the quality is regarded as more important than quantity, and all edible children shipped from here are luxury goods for rich people and seems to be a substitute that does not reach the general demons. Among them, the brain is regarded as important, and when Emma escaped, an instruction is issued not to hurt the head, although it is said that even if the edible boy other than "special" is killed in subordinates from the demon of the plantation It was.\nMass production farm\nIn a low-cost mass production type human farm, we just make the human beings alive, shrink them in a bad environment and ship them. People kept there did not understand the words, there was no name or will. Most of the human farms are such mass-produced farms, and there are hundreds of them. Unlike edible babies in luxury farms, mass production farms do not identify individuals, and fixed emblems are stamped in fixed positions.\nPrimitive faith\nThe religion that Songje and Mujika believe. People say that they do not eat humans for religious reasons, but the details are unknown, but if they are not exactly the form of hunting it seems that they should not have the life God created, like Emma\'s at farms etc. It seems contrary to doctrine to eat farmed livestock. In the world of demons it is not to be able to eat human beings in fact because the existence of human who was born and raised in the outside world has not been confirmed. Songju helped Emma to aim for Emma to make the environment where people can be eaten in a form not contrary to doctrine.\nshelter\nA shelter at point B where you traced with a pen. It exists in the basement of the wilderness. It has all of water, food, electricity, living space, and there are information and materials about the world. A man who fled with his colleagues from a farm called Glorybell lived a year ago, but during that time Minerva never appeared. If his remarks are correct, food in the shelter should have been at least over a year ago, but there are many questions such as whether it can be preserved while maintaining quality for as long as that. Also, there are many unnatural points such as a lot of monitors are installed in the room where he was. The man seems to get information outside these monitors, but the details are unknown at this time.\nThere are not only a bath, a toilet, a kitchen but also a field in the shelter. Water is secured by pulling down groundwater, electricity can generate electricity using organic waste (excreta and garbage etc.) while properly turning on the underground heat, supplement with insufficiency generator using other fuel And that. For that reason, if water and electricity are not used too much, there is nothing to worry about, and waste can also be used for power generation, so garbage is not as environment as possible. Regarding food stockpiles, the man who lived there seems to be considerably consuming during the year seems to be a little left, but outside the shelter birds, snakes and lizards have been confirmed and the field is also increased It seems to be an environment where you can live forever if the number of people is around Emma. However, if you rescued all of the children of Grace = Fieldhouse, it seems impossible to hunt everyone in the shelter, It is an indispensable matter to find a way to go to the world. ref. There is also change of clothes, but even the smallest size is too large for the younger generation, so it can be seen that children arriving at the shelter are supposed to be older than the shipping target.\nAs for the material in the shelter, as well as the Grace Fieldhouse, only things before the year are placed, and the material with descriptions concerning "demons" and "promises" is an ancient document level. A letter from Minerva is sandwiched between documents like this ancient document and it is written to go to point A with a pen if you aim for a place of relief. In addition, other materials include plant maps of farms and demons, objects related to the human world and handwritten demons world, but there are ordinary books such as novels and picture books.\nThere is an emergency destruction device in the back of the data room, although details are unknown, it is presumed that it was in the works that it was installed assuming the existence of the shelter to the demon by any chance. When Ema and Ray discovered the device, the wiring seemed to be broken, but it is unknown whether it was cut off from the beginning or the man cut.\nThere is also a piano and can play, but there is a switch inside the piano, piano moves sideways by pushing switch with umbrella etc. Entrance to arms depot appears. There are a lot of heavy weapons in the arsenal, and there are various other things such as blades, shields and bombs. It was a coincidence that the man noticed the piano mechanism to say, when the man arrived at the shelter it seems that the sound of the piano is extremely slight, but he seems to have been crazy, discovering this room as the companion noticed it I was able to do it. The piano sounds any sound, it returns to the original.\nGoldie pound\nA pond at point A. The details are unknown at this time, but the vicinity is full of settlements of demons and it is in such a dangerous place that it can not compare with a journey from plantation to point B. According to the shelter man, it seems that it takes about a week to bypass a relatively safe route, but passing through that route goes through a route that can be reached with a disgusting day. On the way there is a group of demons of Nara. In the Goldie pound there is a private garden of the aristocrat who is Lord Bayon, the edible children are released and the rich demons are enjoying hunting to meet the hunting instinct. A secret hunting ground in the farmland, many of the edible children supplements the living by the moon with the privilege of Sir Bayillon, while living in the moon, edible children kidnapped like shelter men and their colleagues also It seems to be present. There are colorful villages like the world of picture books, and there are also fields and forests. There are large houses, but details are unknown at this time. Despite the winter the climate is like warmth like spring, the existing plants are completely different from the wild forests of the Nara demon. Speakers are installed in the village, and when the music rings the ogre comes to hunt for edible children.\n\n\xc2\xa0Other\n\xc2\xa0Year, the nomination of the comic awards comics department to come to the 1st time refhttptsugimangajpnominatecomics From the list of nominated works by Comics Division Comics Div.

(Ms. Hiragiri is looking for a jibun.) Is a manga work by Hiroyuki Nishimori. In "Weekly Shonen Sunday" (Shogakkan), serializing from the year.\n\n\xc2\xa0Synopsis\nWhile a male high school student, Keijiro Hakuba has said that he is not interested in women, he encounters a mysterious beautiful girl. Keijiro who was told only from her that she knew that her memory was "Hiiragi" was accepted at that pace and accepted at her parents\' house. Hiragi \'s power and strength has something reminiscent of "Princess", and Keijiro\' s parents are gradually fascinated.\n\nMeanwhile, master, Hida who taught martial arts to Keijiro avoids encounters when Keijiro brought Hiiragi in search of clues for memory, suggesting that Hiiragi is a dangerous existence. I wonder if it is not a human being but a monster of soul eating (fond) \xc2\xb7 "they are not" ....\n\n\xc2\xa0Character \n\xc2\xa0main character \n\xc2\xa0Hiiragi (hello)\n\xc2\xa0The main character of this work. First person is "\xe5\x84\x82". His tone and phrase was old-fashioned, I knew about donuts while I do not know the mirror, manga, hospital, how to use water, etc. There are no memories other than being "Hiiragi" himself, but something like a flashback occasionally reminds me of something. I think of myself as "a bit mean," but quite a princess-like temperament to the side. I could not sleep without the experience of people sleeping and not being afraid of what I am not afraid of.\n\xc2\xa0Although it seems to act naturally as it is thought but forces himself to blame violence against Robert to those who work on evil things, wearing a cat on the first meeting with Keijiro\'s mother Actually quite a calculation There is also a place that makes the impression such as "evil", "black princess" embrace around because the speech while doing is also conspicuous. On the other hand, when I destroy the water supply, I also feel comfortable thinking that I try to do something by myself so that I do not wake up sleeping Keijiro.\n\xc2\xa0The first memory on the time axis under construction is in the process of falling from somewhere and land on the loading platform of the running truck. Even this alone is a physical ability that is unknown to a girl, but from the top of the building sliding his feet from there, noticing the child who fell and jumping with the jumping force that was separated from the normal person, even if he gets the child and lands on the ground there is nothing to do with the body Appearance. Moreover, although it is a imitation sword, owner of bad strength such as bending a sword.\n\xc2\xa0Keijiro Hakuba (HAKUKA Keijiro)\n\xc2\xa0Semi-main character. It is a male high school student who is male-oriented and is respected regardless of gender in the school. It was a straight personality from early childhood, and sometimes confronted with power by direct opinion to adults who were out of the rules from childhood. I am under the hands of martial art under Hida.\n\xc2\xa0While sitting on the bench with barefoot sitting on the bench for the first time while being told from the first meeting Hiiragi running to buy shoes as they were asked to wear it while asking for it, the woman was professed not to be totally interested, "Actually touching that white foot I wanted it, "she seems to be attracted by her exquisite appearance and mysterious charm. Its behavior is expected to be big in Hiiragi, becoming a "one servant" and I intended to just be on a joke but I will keep Kei Hiiri at my parents who knew seriously and was likely to be protected by the police.\n\xc2\xa0There is no resistance to acts such as putting shoes against Hiiri, washing your feet. When I spend the night while sitting in the front of the room to relieve the hiiragi who can not sleep, I do not want to let us feel unnecessary, because it is a gentleman, for example "I just came a while ago".\n\n\xc2\xa0Hakuba family\n\xc2\xa0Keijiro\'s father\n\xc2\xa0Although I live in a quite a mansion house where there are toilets in places, a state of a very ordinary salaried worker. When listening to Kiyujiro\'s request to keep Hiiragi from my wife, I was shocked to drop my bag. I thought that Keijiro was a pride of being a pride, I was impatient that I was dismayed that I saw a scene of washing my legs and overnight in front of the room and saw a new side, but I was impressed again by the dignified attitude . Listen to the interaction between Hiiragi in store and Osassu from Imakara industry from his wife, and completely believe that Hiiragi is a princess who has time slipped from the world of Sengoku.\n\xc2\xa0Keijiro\'s mother\n\xc2\xa0I run an antique dealer (Keijiro Iwaku "One hand"). Keijiro thoroughly calls "Keijiro Sun" but I truly confused when I asked everyone to ask me to keep Hiiragi. Initially it was a stance that it is not easy to forgive him, because it is "a little cute" against Hiiragi, but I will change my mind by tightening my heart with the words of Hiiragi that he does not want to inconvenience. Witnessing the interaction between Hiiragi at the store and Osan of Imakara industry, I fully believe that Hiiragi is the princess who has been time slipping from the world of Sengoku.\n\xc2\xa0Keijiro\'s older brother\n\xc2\xa0Although its existence is talked about as a topic, it has not appeared in this volume.\n\n\xc2\xa0Keijiro\'s school official\n\xc2\xa0Sawai Chiaki (Sayawa \xe3\x81\xbf \xe3\x81\xa1 \xe3\x81\xbf)\n\xc2\xa0Appears from the first search (it also appeared in the recollection scene of the first search).

Its identity is Tengu, I feel the atmosphere different from ordinary people about Hiiragi I saw for the first time, consult with the built-in.

Although I tried to rule the school as "King of the King" and "Kuzu Kuzu" by pairing with the left gate, but both have failed.\n\xc2\xa0Like the left gate there is no physical strength. Although it is not as much as smiling or tragic love, the school\'s grades are also bad, the ranking of the previous term is 287 out of 300 people. On the other hand, on the other hand, the domestic aspect of cuisine is good at it, the left gate which ate the porridge lunch made by Kyuu Dragon sheds tears in too much taste and the clothes that it was wearing flicker.

From that experience it seemed familiar to the usage of the demon of the left gate, and even when fighting, he was treating the devil without any doubt. When fighting exclusively stop the devil by body art. The withdrawal of unfortunate talk is amazing.

There are also natural aspects such as truly receiving a lazy lecture on the left gate. In addition to the above-mentioned nature, the introverted personality was disaster and thought that I wanted to play with my friends, I could not resist mothers who do excessive interference, but as my left paw pushed my back, my mind gave my opinion straight from my mother I could relate.

In the case of Nine-headed Dragon, the Sfn Comics 4 volumes are explained that the demon has become visible after witnessing the scene where the left gate summons the devil. However, even in that case, it seems that the distance and the size of the devil itself are involved, and the smile is still not showing the devil. Also there are some exceptions that can become invisible as transparent as Sargatanas and Gracia - Laboras. Although it is necessary to draw a magic team for summoning, it is not necessary to be a special tool, and if such a figure is drawn, instead of being usable, it is disposable and draw it with the size suitable for the subject to be summoned There is no doubt. On the other hand, the left gate copies with a copy machine or sticker, or projects it on the screen of a fog with a projector. Therefore, in a narrow closed room where such a small workmen can not be used, the left gate falls and becomes a small fish at once.\nRelationships of devils are pretty good with friendship of parties and friends, peaceful if the left gate is not considered as well as "left gates Akosuke victim party" and there is no left gate.\n\n\xc2\xa0Wiluwisupu\n\xc2\xa0Lower evil spirit.

However, when Bouche Yasta has inserted coffee which is not compatible as a demon who is in charge of sleep, he thinks how to do it without being able to do without it, and shows a serious aspect as it is.\n\xc2\xa0It was summoned to the left gate, but it was left without being returned to hell, and in the angel Kagahara family it is in a state like a mind.

For some reason cherry blossoms can only give an effect to make a stomach hungry, but when incarcerated Nebiross received the ability of Behemoth, it was undergoing even damage that it did not stand up even. Like Boucher Yasta, it is being left out by summoning.\n\xc2\xa0There is also a gentlemanly and gentle aspect, such as giving a hot dog to the nine-headed dragon who is hard-boiled adult person who is calm deposit without looking out and who is hungry without money.

Touching the subject transforms himself into that person, and the personality is exactly opposite to that of the person himself. Therefore, when transforming into cherry blossoms became a poisonous character, becoming a popular person when transforming into a left gate or Kurodori dragon. The transformation can be solved if a transferee gets caught, or a third party gets caught in a state where his / her physical strength is exhausted. If a third party is caught in the condition that the physical strength is not exhausted, it turns into that person this time.\n\xc2\xa0Three Aho hair and Guruguru cheeks are characteristic both before and after transformation, so it seems quite dubious, but from a person who does not know the devil, basically its identity is not noticed.\n\n\xc2\xa0Anra Manueli-Mayu\n\xc2\xa0birthday:? / Height: 154 cm / Favorite things: Negative / Dislike: Huge voice / Vocal: You can be jealous of most things Sfn Comics 2 volumes\n\xc2\xa0Zoroastrianism The demon which is the top of the demon.

However, it does not mean to say things that are not in mind, even to the extent to which the selfish request is also known to the person himself / herself.

Three additions to the ranking within this "red dragon pillar" represent the status of each member in hell.\nIt is definitely a man of power and can do if you do the work but usually there is a difference in degree, most members excluding one or two people are missing out.\nBy the way, the red dragon of the red dragon\'s "red dragon" is a kind of technical term originally, but in the work it is the name of the organization to which they belong. Although it seems that the rank of the devil probably refers to the description of "\xe5\xa4\xa7 \xe5\xa5\xa5 \xe7\xbe\xa9 \xe6\x9b\xb8" ("\xe3\x82\xb0 \xe3\x83\xa9 \xe3\x83\xb3 \xc2\xb7 \xe3\x82\xb0 \xe3\x83\xaa \xe3\x83\xa2 \xe3\x82\xa2"), in this book there is a different book named "red dragon" as it is, accidentally Whether the author\'s intention is a mystery, it shows an interesting match.\n\n\xc2\xa0Rukifugus\n\xc2\xa0Birthday: December 31 (self-designation) / Height: 172 cm / Favorite things: Late night belt / Dislikes: Extension of baseball live / Special skill: Finishing work of Plamo Sfn Comics 7\n\xc2\xa0The prime minister as the first pillar of "the six pillars of the red dragon" (\xe2\x84\x96 4 in hell).

A general supervisor who monitors and manages demons around the world. He is also a judge. (Although it\'s an asyloid but in the process it is not a court to decide innocent conviction and punishment mainly on the site, but there are many patterns to enforce (to keep) without trial, but by tradition (Nebosu of the original neta) Nebros is a prosecutor There is a theory that it was). She has a long-haired, eyebrow-free, three-pronged man. With a serious personality, it is very bad with the left gate to summon his men on the groundless reasons, a rival that often collides. It is also the president of "Association of Victims of Left Gate Norin". From the left gate is called "Major General", from bad to "Neibiki".\n\xc2\xa0There is strong sense of justice to be unlikely to be a devil, and not only the devil but also human beings are included in the patrons subject, the world is destroyed by tantrums Looking at the unruly game with habit of scattering the influence of scale and scattering Earth It is a level where I think imperceptibly with Masui.\n\xc2\xa0Originally, cherry blossoms are easy to be targeted to devils, but the raids of the Yaba death satan of Christian relations (the meaning of the dangerous devil at the lethal level) and the attacks of the lower devils sent as thugs from them are all As the supervisor, Nebiros, is holding back, cherry blossoms are protected from those attacks. Since inviting the left gate to the ghost to save the oppressing cherry blossom at the left gate to be monitored, she has a favor with her.\n\xc2\xa0Once was forced to live as homeless in the human world, but was picked up by the master of the coffee shop "Cafe KITAZAWA", it came to work with the pseudonym Nebi Nebina husband. It is over 3000 years old, but 28 years old as a human being (Neibi).\n\xc2\xa0My primary professional is Necromancer and I use Willy Wisp as my usual means of attack, like the left gate. Magic teams like the summoner like the left gate are unnecessary and can be summoned simultaneously from the air simultaneously, so it is possible to fire the fire with immediate sequential shooting. In Mastema warfare we are currently using some powerful techniques.\n\xc2\xa0What is different about religion is something like so-called "president of another company", but it does not raise himself standing, but in fact it is smart enough to call it "Baba" or "Influba Baa".\n\xc2\xa0The incarnation state (human body) is a temporary body for the devil, but at the same time it is also a genuine body and a living body of life, so in Mastema warfare, in response to the summon of the left gate responds in response to the summons of the left gate I showed the figure of the devil on the ground. When it gets disengaged, the costume becomes a long coat similar to military uniforms, and although the volume of hair increases, it seems that she seems to be tired from the era when he was frequently summoned to the left gate. In the summoned state, I showed a very spirited battle with the left gate.\nIn the popular vote, it is fourth in Nebiros and 17th in the Nebi Nebbi husband.\n\n\xc2\xa0Salgatanas\n\xc2\xa0Birthday: March 12 (self-designation) / Height: 165 cm (including hat) / Favorite things: Sweets / Dislikes: Dark atmosphere / Special skill: Sweet things are different belly Sfn Comics 3 volumes\n\xc2\xa0The head of the journey of the 6th pillar of "The Riddle of the Red Dragon" (No. 9 in Hell).

Over 3000 years old.\n\xc2\xa0Although I adore Nebiros, even if I try to become the power of Nebros, its essence is "to make things worse in nature", so it will not be a bad thing. Also, it seems that she does not dislike it which is used conveniently because it is casually talking with state as it came from himself (because it is not summoned and not submissive) in the state of talking to himself.\n\xc2\xa0In addition to "unlocking keys", the ability has diverse skills specialized in secret behaviors and assassinations such as "transparency, eavesdropping, instantaneous movement". Although it is a junior of Nebiros and the hierarchy is one downward, from the left gate is also said to be "strong against a hundred times the storm of Nebros," Neibilis himself also trusts her ability in fact.\n\xc2\xa0By the way, the author of the swamp says that every time it appears, it is making a minor change in design.

Nebros is said to be "a devil wanted to give temptations and trials to people, lose temptation to hell, guides those who overcome trials to heaven, Nebros says," Test evil of human faith, that is necessary evil to serve God ". The appearance is a gentle gentleman, but the name has a distorted idea that stems from ethics derived from the "hostility" of the Hebrew language, and that behavior was enough to instinctively shudder cherry blossoms. The human being who lost the temptation loses greed, turns into a scrape of indifferent indifference, eventually abandoning even the physiology necessary for life such as "appetite" and so on. Let\'s make Jeanne d\'Arc a sacred man and lead him to the way to the burning death penalty, abduct the cherry blossoms with a good feeling that "the same smell" with Jeanne is present, burn her and let Jeanne\'s tragedy reoccur It was. At the same time, in the process of identifying humans called cherry blossoms, they sow tempted people in the city including the ninja dragon and further contacted the devils classified as "fallen angels" of the "red dragon", " I released it and return it to heaven "and attacked the demons who refused the request one after another and gave a big blow to the" red dragon "(only Garp with instantaneous mobility was unharmed).\nBuilding a tower on the mountain of countered abducted cherry blossoms and observing the left gates heading for cherry rescue as "trials". Battle with the left gate which dismissed the three bodies and went up to the top floor one step ahead. Neibros, who delayed the merger due to the damage received from Andrus, are also driven to instant death easily, offsetting various summons including his surprise campaign with tactics and simple power. However, even though the left gate is overwhelmed by the left gate summoning the original Neibilus freed from the limitation of "incarnation" due to being killed, even though the two gods overwhelm the combination, actually revealing that his existence is also positive, As a "first trial" to make cherry blossom a virgin, I will drop a large group of dead spirits of my own to the city and try to destroy corrupt people. However, it was also shielded in the shade and the other six front pillars jointly fight (prediction of the purpose of the enemy by agaria lept of "omniscience", securing a large amount of salt by "Furoreti" of "work completion", "female attraction "Secured human resources through Satanakia \'s" securing salt beam ", which was created by himself, was completely destroyed by the strike of the left gate and Nebros\' stop. After being defeated, Nebilos and his left gate judged that the man is dangerous, and he is obstructed into the body of Abadon summoned by the left gate. In addition, it seems that an emergency meeting where the tops of heaven and hell gathered was held due to the damage of human beings and devils due to the runaway of this time\'s mashema, but also that the heavenly people understood the abnormal personality of the above Mastema There seems to have never been any worsening of the relationship between the two.\n\nMedusa\nA famous snake hair woman demon "to turn those who saw that eye into a stone". In the "tower of trial" as the first assassin waits for the left gate and the Neibilus, but from the weak point that the existence of the stone can not make the petrification inherited, there is no depiction of fighting by the gargoyl summoned by the left gate (monitoring It was sunk in the moment when Mastema was out there.\n\nBarakiel\nA corner of the grigori who is said to be "depressed by being in love with a human woman". As the name implies "thunder lightning of God", if it is human, it can emit lightning strikes at the instant death level. It is very prideful, and it is furiously excited when called "fallen angel". As a second barrier he will attack the left gates, but battle with RUKUFUGUS in battle mode which self-name "love devil" that the left gate summons as a pinch hit. Ruki fugs who won the fourth place in hell with the ability won without serious hands and legs, and it was completely unilaterally defeated (although motive for Rukifugus seriously said "Make cherry blossom kiss for reward" In spite of the evil spiritual descent, neither the left gate nor Nebros was white, even the cherry tree himself was convinced that the complete victory was due to "Moyomoya").\n\nAndras\nA rough giant wearing a tuxedo. It is the authorization of the word "violence", and from the point of killing the surroundings regardless of the enemy or ally, it has the alias "killing of Andus".

The world was covered with snow, starvation and madness by the blessing called ice witch. The frozen people asked for flames.\n\xc2\xa0Luna, a boy, Agni and sister, is a blessed person with excellent physical ability to regenerate, Agni had her arms cut off by Luna and lived together while giving it to the people of the village as food. One day the soldiers of the Kingdom of Behemdorg push into the village and try to rob the food and fuel. Soldiers\' leader-rated doma is aiming to collect valuable young workforce and beat the witches of ice and invites Agni, a young young man in the elderly village, to Behemdorg. However, when finding flesh from the village houses, they instructed to withdraw troops. Domma keeps saying that he is a blessed to Agni, that he can not ignore the village, and burns everything in the village. In the village where the burned dead body of the villager rolled, Agni was not able to die. Burning by doma Agni whose burning and regeneration of the body is repeated indefinitely by a flame that will not disappear until it decays. As I suffer from unimaginable pain, I notice that I can die by refusing to play. I hope to be easy to die but it is said to "live" in Luna, which is close to dust suffering from burning. Eight years have passed since the hatred of Doma, struggling to struggle to be burned, remember how to use regenerative ability, succeed in removing the flame of the face, begin a journey of revenge to Doma.\n\xc2\xa0In the course of transporting slaves including Sun, the beheads of Behemdorg killed the old slaves by the commander\'s captain, and the sun suffering from the captain\'s eclipse was about to be killed. When Sun asks God for salvation, Agni appears by chance. Agni who saw the slave\'s corpse is angry and kills all of the Behemdorg\'s soldiers. Agni remembers suddenly his past. A story about the food that the father told me to live, a tragedy in which my parents were killed. Agni aims at Behemdorg as a source of hatred for domestic.\n\xc2\xa0Sun thought that Agni was a god and was keeping on. While trying to spend the night with Agni, Agni is attacked by a soldier of Behemdorg who was watching the bridge. Sun is taken hostage, and by the electricity of his own blessing, the avalanches get caught getting out of the crisis. The sun is saved by the flame of Agni, and the sun turns around again. Agni escapes by seeing the gap of Sun, but Sun will lead Judas to Agni.\n\xc2\xa0Agni was slashed his head by Judah, became ineffective, and shook violently against Judas who had a figure that closely resembled Luna. It is wrapped in a refractory cloth and brought back to Behemdorg.\n\xc2\xa0On the other hand, Sun is placed in a room with Behemdorg and meets Nenet captured by Behemdorg. Jack, who brought two dogs together, forced San and Nenet to beat the dog with a dog. Sun and Nenet are trying to escape from the room, but Jack\'s younger brother Ivan cuts under the knees of Sun and is blocked.\n\xc2\xa0Agni was shot by the soldiers of Behemdorg in a state from above the neck while being restrained from playing but Agni fights back against the soldiers while fighting against the soldiers. Doma who did not remember Luna and Agni, this is the forgiveness of the crime of Luna\'s murder. This action reverses Agni, Agni challenges the domestic battle but also has no teeth at all.\n\xc2\xa0The video camera switch was pressed indoors. I was turning the camera, a movie lover called Togata. While reflecting oneself, I am interested in the burning appearance of Agni, talk about taking a movie with Agni as the main character. The title of the movie is Fireman.\n\xc2\xa0Agni, who had no teeth at all, was wrapped in a refractory cloth and transported to the sea by a subway road by soldiers including regenerating blessings such as Judas, Simon, Ivan. Nenet was also taken, and it was supposed to be raped by soldiers of Ivan and others. Togata appeared there and was turning the camera. Togata rescued Nenet anything on condition that he heard the order, killing Ivan and others. Neneto was appointed as a photographer. Togata will kill Simon, cut Judah\'s neck which he participated and make it unable to fight.

He pointed out that he did a cannibalism in an unfamiliar world, pointed out that Agni, who baked Behemdorg, was not educated, and because he himself was not well educated, he made a mistake. It says that in Behemdorg, in order to facilitate brainwashing, you see the image of God. However, one day, Domma knew, looking at the loot he brought back by the soldiers of Behemdorg. The movie I was watching was a movie for entertainment. Thinking that he was a god and praying for him was a film actor.\nTokiga hesitating it attacks the doma. It was a domestic who burned the house of Togata, and robbed Togata\'s life. As we continue to assault, the gunshakes rings, the children appear and protect the domes. Children will die if there is no doma. Agni leaves from the domestic.\nOn my way home, Agni asked Togata. If the hero of the movie, you killed the doma. Togata says.

Ice of the lake which begins to melt. Togata\'s persuasion did not come true, Aguni desperately desperated fell to the lake.\nAgni in the form before being baked was in the movie theater. Go to the theater as Togata says. Luna was sitting there. Picking away Agni pleasing, Togata sits beside Luna. What was being screened was when he was a child of Togata.

The togata which touched the fire of Agni was burned. Unimaginable pain, Togata thinks of the last words. Suddenly thinking Agni, smile, "live" When you say so, Togata will survive. Having held a torpedo tombato hanging back in front of Agni\'s eyes was a huge tree that stretches out the roots and kills people. Soul appears there.

Whether the person who is short stature is also concerned, when it was pointed out to the likelihood, it is saying "There is no chicken!"\n\xc2\xa0It boasts unrivaled excellence in science, but it can not be converted to numerical value in the contrary, it has become an obstacle in the field which can not be understood by the theory, hence it is not good to read the partner\'s emotions, It is devastating to the lowest level of the grade level ref group note It is enough to interpret the irony as well as to solve the sentence problem of modern sentences by mathematical expression. / ref.\n\xc2\xa0As I am not interested in others and are also floating from the surroundings, my relaxation is mostly for one person, and it is the temporary link Ubongo enUbongo and Nimut who came out while playing a hobby analog game ref group. / ref alone, I am interested in reading human\'s emotions as described above, so it is weak in interpersonal warfare even if there is no problem to play alone. I became willing to learn psychology as a result of holding the feeling that I want to win the game with psychology from such regret to myself, I am applying for a university in the literature.\n\xc2\xa0It\'s pretty lame for the character \'s nature, it seems to behave indifferently and it tends to be unexpectedly emotional. Moreover, weak points are many other than the literature such as weak darkness and can not swim, but when it is pointed out because of its losing of mind, it usually roughly strengthens and denies it.\n\xc2\xa0My parents run a noodle shop, and when I arrive at a fixed time I go down to help the shop, and I also going out for noodles at night.\n\xc2\xa0Initially I did not recognize the name of Yukie of the next seat in the science science class, but I showed my impression of Suzuki\'s action which pours my heart into my education in my own way and I will remember his name later and call me at the same time . I will embrace love emotions in success, but I am not conscious of it.\n\xc2\xa0Furuhashi Fumino (Furusashi Fumino)\n\xc2\xa03 years A group affiliation. Known as "good at modern sentences, old writings and Chinese writing" "Sleeping beauty sleeping princess of literary forest". Appearance is black hair long, style is good as model, but it is depressed if it is pointed out because poor breast is small. Also his hands are quite clumsy. Handedness is left handed left hand. Oftentimes I am dozing off in class.\n\xc2\xa0In the literature there is nothing to come to the right, but the science problem is devastating, on the contrary, the principal said "When looking at the mathematical expression, the head turns white." However, from the influence of the mother who passed away at a young age, he aimed to live with the star and wish for a university of science to learn astronomy.\n\xc2\xa0As with the beads, I am not very interested in others, but only the beads recognize because they are genius to each other. Moreover, although it is not malicious to the person himself, there is a tendency to do a bitter telling.\n\xc2\xa0My parents are wealthy, but as mentioned above the mother is dead, there are no brothers and sisters, and living with two fathers, but the father seems to be intimidating personality, parent and child relationship is not good, she He is also not conscious of intimidating men himself.\n\xc2\xa0Initially I did not recognize the name of Yukiyuki of the next seat in the literature class, and even when he was appointed to the education staff I called him for the first time, but in my own way to educate myself I am deeply impressed with the attitude of Yukiyuki poured heartblood, after that I will remember his name and call me at the same time.\n\xc2\xa0I am conscious of Yukue as a heterosexual, but by accidentally knowing the feelings of Bekki and Kanoka \'s successor, I am holding down my consciousness.\n\xc2\xa0Takeo Takemoto (Takeuma Yuka)\n\xc2\xa03 years D group affiliation.

With an active personality, always high tension and always self-paced behavior are conspicuous, and one side that can not read the air such as disturbing one missing such as not being able to understand other person\'s utterances at all or disturbing the place of study and causing inconvenience However, because I like to be able to play with my friends, I accept some counterattacks with a smile. On the other hand, when you learn the true intention of Suwaki, you become obedient, sometimes you read the air by thinking around.\n\xc2\xa0Because it is a sports specialist, he is a sports utility, belongs to the swimming club, boasts a high level of athletic ability enough to quickly swim like 25 m as a motor boat. Originally the time of swimming was sluggish like the former school of good-bye, there was a circumstance that it became possible to leave the current good result by repeated practice. Although sports is a genius in this way, on the other hand, subjects other than physical education are devastating.\n\xc2\xa0Although I had hoped to go to a university of sports recommendation, from this year I will receive education of Suwaku as a result of the addition of the English test in addition to the achievement of the competition for the recommendation entrance examination of the applicant school, Although it was doing, it gradually increases grades according to the educational law of Seiyuki.\n\xc2\xa0The reason why I am not good at studying is that I am spending part time on time to spend my studies in addition to a simple weak consciousness, and my head is never bad if I can clear even the hurdle that I can not concentrate on my studies. Indeed, during testing of English words, Yukue is rapidly growing by devising a study method linked to her favorite swimming.\n\xc2\xa0She clearly holds romantic emotions against Yukiyuki who is observing her circumstances. However, with regard to romantic relations super-affixed. For that reason, it is regarded as a joke because of acts that are not likely to act positively or are not likely to occur. There is also a case that there is awareness about the fact that he is a hetarer to love from time to time because some of his club members are also being made a fun of himself. (If he / she likes to take an approach, he / she tells in middle school days "). Also, there is a considerable delusional delusions habit.\n\n\xc2\xa0Family of characters\n\xc2\xa0Yuuko Suigi (Yui Mizuki)\n\xc2\xa0Yoshiyuki\'s long sister.

Beijing seems to be "unhappy with money accounts", not only in helping the store but also on the management of gold as well.\n\xc2\xa0Father of Asumi\n\xc2\xa0He is a father of Asami who runs Komi-naki clinic. For a girl who is not good at science, the doctor tells the doctor to look for the way that suits him without aiming, but I will see the state by persuasion of Yukiyuki. Although it is personality who thinks the patient first, the sense of management is not good and can not be said that the clinic keeps barking birds singing. Although it is not as much as the father of the bead, but there is a stupid face, Asuzi believed in a bogus way when hinted that Yukue would be his own boyfriend in order to hide a byte at a maid cafe.\n\n\xc2\xa0Other people\n\xc2\xa0Kobayashi\n\xc2\xa0Seiyuku\'s classmate. Koyuki is a relationship from junior high school days, called "Naru-chan".

He belongs to the football club, and also has a popularity from girls because of being a handsome guy. After understanding the personality of Funno and calculating it as it attacks a few times if it attacks a few times, I have confessed to her many times, but the person himself is not malicious, and ultimately persuaded Suaki who knew it I gave up on her carefully.\nSaeko Sekiro (Seki Sawako)\n\xc2\xa0Director of Chemical Division. In the science examination it is the second most behind the whales because it is second only to the ___ ___ ___ 0 ___ ___ 0 ___ ___ 0 ___ ___ 0 ___ ___ 0 She seems to be coming from the feeling that she wants to be friends with her and reveals her true desire to go to the same university in a conversation with Yukiyuki. The white coat layered from the top of the uniform is a trademark.\n\xc2\xa0The observation eyes are high such as observing a certain event from the behavior of the bead when it is likely to be found by naked girls with a mistake of a bead, and at that time it helps happiness by a swift movement at that time (However, the person himself said "I am lent" that I\'m satisfied with) I also show a gentle aspect.\n\xc2\xa0Kawase (Kaisei)\n\xc2\xa0A fellow friend who belongs to the swimming department.

Speech with stout eyes talk in soft and calm tone. It seems that it is judging whether a man approaching Bunno is suitable for Bunno. I made a misunderstanding that Kanno and Kanno were going out from a hint. Then, I mobilized all members of the thorns\' association in the library and watched the situation of the two. As a result, I understood that it was a misunderstanding, and it seems that the surveillance has been solved. At a later date, I murmur with Yukino and Funno "Encouraged by her deep faith that she crossed the fence with her deep faith."\n\xc2\xa0Inomori\n\xc2\xa0Members of "Bora no Kai" with Fumino\'s classmate. Boyish and refreshing personality. It features thick eyebrows.\n\xc2\xa0Butterflies\n\xc2\xa0Members of "Bora no Kai" with Fumino\'s classmate.

Although I approved qualifications for special VIP recommendation after evaluating Sogo for the first time, I decided to appoint Yukino as a condition for that, Fumino, Rika, and Ukaka\'s education officer and then let him go on to a university that aspires to them Battle the problem (Shuno Iwaku "for achievement and moral protection"). In addition, the reason why the teacher had served as a teacher of Bunno and Riku to Yukie is unknown.\n\xc2\xa0Kirisu Midwinter (Kirisu Mafuyu)\n\xc2\xa0A teacher at Ichinose Gakuen. Funno and the first educator in Beijing (by the way, Yukiyuki is the seventh ref group note / The refinement by the speech of the Rhin in the first episode / ref).

I thought that "educators should lead to a talented road regardless of the student\'s feelings", he did not acknowledge any educational policy of S\xc5\x8dkyu at all, he said "Elegance of foolishness such as raising a genius to an ordinary person" There. On the other hand, there is also a gentle aspect, such as getting lost in the mountain and trying hard to find his hands full of scratches.\n\xc2\xa0I was a figure skater in my school days, and trophies and shields were decorated in the room, so I won a lot of competitions, but from my experience of abandoning my talent with temporary feelings, I love my students Even though it is not, I am sticking to the attitude that I should not pursue reckless dreams and to advance the way I do not waste my talent.\n\xc2\xa0While I usually dress up a majestic suit, on the other hand, Zubora is private, the room has turned into a dirty room (it can not be cleaned), books and garbage bags are scattered from the front door, underwear is scattered Though it is, it is cleaned once by Noriyuki, but after only a few stories back it is back. While wearing a sweat, I bought it elegantly at a convenience store, but even it seems to be a stylish style, I spend my time in a high school jersey in my room. Naturally, I was hiding in the strangers but it is known by the accidentally encountered Yukiyuki.\n\xc2\xa0Originally it was criticizing the adults and repeatedly only the cold speech but testimony to help him when interviewing with happiness due to happening at the studying camp (although the content seems to be disadvantageous to him It was only a matter of doing) and understand that Suwaki is trusted in true meaning by witnessing the appearance of ___ ___ ___ ___ ___ ___ 0 You will be able to show a slight smile with watching scenes that are pleasant (however, returning to usual face as soon as saying "I\'m careless").\n\xc2\xa0I am not good at hot items and can not eat curry even though it is not good at insects and when cockroaches emerge in the room they can not stay in the room because they are scared and the only trustworthy person goes through the apartment Until such a moment I kept waiting in a suit in the scorching sun, and when the cockroach reappeared again I was losing margin to cling to success in trembling. It is also a considerable scuttle, such as falling further and being buried in the mountain of books, wearing a bucket with water from the head trying to clean it. It is also quite a shopping door, and as soon as it contains a little alcohol, the personality changes, the usual harsh words are reversed, irrespective of who they were critically criticized, praising someone.\n\xc2\xa0Azumi Komi Azumi (Kominei Asami)\n\xc2\xa0The graduate of Ichinose Gakuen which adults attend is a top graduate.

Among them, the performance of the competition dance department was especially attracting attention. Tsuchiya Masaharu of the freshman is caught by a friend, heading to the experience entry part of the competition dance department for the purpose of lucky skill for body touch with beautiful seniors. Many boys with the same purpose had already gathered in front of the club room, but threatened by Masumi Toi Igaki who is the chief of the competition dance department appeared there, all the members will escape leaving the captured Tsuchiya. Tsuchiya left behind was greeted by Akira Doi and Deputy Director Akira Ayatsuji as well as the only girls who came to receive the experience entrance Watari Aki, step into the world of competitive dance .\nTsuchiya and Warumi, who formed a couple, attended the first game at Mishima after a month of entrance, after having taught by the senior members\' eight chapters and Akiko Tsubaki, and the same age group\'s skillful dancer \xc2\xb7 Okimusi Do & Tanya . However, Riki Waraki can not move during performance with extreme tension, and ends with the primary preliminary elimination. Two people who swear they will try harder while being tasted the difference of circumstances. In the ensuing cultural festival, we will dance in front of all the students as a demonstration, and practice quick steps in the standard department, "Dance to enjoy together as well". When preparing for the outing of the class, they talked about the reason why they entered the dance section, and Wataraki confesses hard memories of elementary school days. On the day of the event, I managed to suppress the tension somehow and I was going to go to the stage, but I heard that the students at other schools accidentally made remarks to chill out the costume of the dance department. Tsuchiya goes searching for a witness that does not show its appearance even at the time of the meeting. Tsuchiya has revealed that she was able to become unnecessary thanks to Watari who was able to find wild places even though she could only apologize with tears, although she actually had a similar experience at elementary school age. Encourage me. The two who returned to the stage with the cooperation of the classmate danced in the cheers.\nIn June, Hirata Fujita, a first-grader, will be newly touched by the dance of Tsuchiya of the cultural festival and welfare. Tsuchiya participated in a competition in the city as an outpost of the summer national competition, "All Japan \xc2\xb7 Junior Dance Sports Cup", and gold dance studios led by Mr. Tomi & Tanya and Doi Higaki rival \xc2\xb7 Kinryonin Takamasa fight. Tsuchiya was questioned as to why he is doing a dance with Miya Koi Yuta belonging to the Gold Dance Studio, who is short and talented, and he was disturbed with the Miya Daiko with his will without his will by the trees who broke into it Air is produced. Meanwhile, the 8th sticking to winning Doi Fugi is going to show off unconventional acting incorporating fighting sports in the Latin sector and to attract spectators\' attention, but because he tried to help partner Akiko fell down The eyelids were injured, and the performance finally ended with unacceptable grades without being highly appreciated by the judges. And Tsuchiya & Warumi danced some of the four kinds while becoming Bate Bate in the Standard Preliminary Preliminaries, breaking through the first qualifying and fulfilling the last disgrace. When looking at the situation of such two people, Miya carpenter knows the original feeling that dance is "fun".\nNationwide competition is coming soon, Doi Higaki runs a summer camp. Hirari is decided to pair with eight volumes in the standard department. Doi Ogaki\'s older sister, Richmonde Lindenberg, joins the guidance, and the harsh lesson progresses. In the evening half of the training camp, Mr. Ao confessed to Doi fence that he wanted to resolve a pair that continued from early childhood at the next National Conference due to differences in physical strength and talent, and Doi Higaki never disappointed And accept it.\nThe student champion \'s Sakumoto Joji & Nagashima Sara\' s pair and popular idol \'s Hanazono Ryo and Miki Emi also participate in the TV program and the national competition will start in a row of actors. Rio \'s mind keeps hesitating, and he wishes to finish as he wishes to finish with the final victory. Tsuchiya and Wilti reached the standard primary preliminary carefully and delivered "Tachida boost" of the original choreography (Special Moves) created in the training camp in the second qualifying quick step, such as making the champion Sakamoto stunned However, as with the previous party, I lost there and Tsuchiya realized my regret from my heart for the first time. And Doi Haki pair goes to the standard final, and immediately before the performance, Doi Hige seeking Rio to reconsider the matter of resolving when winning this time. As a result, the victory has surpassed the splendid Sakamoto pair, the members of the competition dance department feel a tearful feeling uniformly. Subsequently the Latin category. The eight volumes & Akiko who dragged their previous failures with their heart still show struggle while not being able to be completely monolithic. However, Sakamoto does not come to Sakamoto and asks "Will the opportunity to win win only today?" Sakuhama asked "(Dance is up to high school) on this side (pro)?" Thus the national competition closed, Tsuchiya and Warui did not get excited and they were losing thoughts toward the next competition in the returning Shinkansen.\nTwo years later, Doi Higashi and Rio played overseas, the 8th and Akiko went to Tokyo and entered the first year of pro. Tsuchiya, Wakiya, Hirari who were third graders in Kanonkan High School \'s competition dance department were hard to teach their juniors.\n'
